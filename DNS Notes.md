The additional NS and SOA type records that were listed for your domain name are important for working with DNS. These records were created automatically for you when you registered your domain name. The name server (NS) record contains the names of the authoritative name servers that authorize you to place DNS records in this DNS server. Those same authoritative name servers are listed with the registrar that you leased your domain name from. That way the authoritative name server can verify that the DNS records and the DNS registration match and are authorized to represent the domain name when defining DNS records. Otherwise a hacker could just add DNS records and take over your domain name.

The start of authority (SOA) record provides contact information about the owner of this domain name.
