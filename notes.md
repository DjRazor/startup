### Things I learned about github:
- How to create a personal access token for an easier authentication process
  - Go to profile, settings, personal access tokens, generate a new one
- How to write markdown (https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#lists)
- How to push via VS Code (commit first, add commit notes, save notes, then sync changes).
- How to pull (open gitbash, type git pull)
