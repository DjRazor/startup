# Startup

## Elevator Pitch
For my startup (Trackinator), I want to create the ultimate scheduling calendar for students. In school, there are several different programs or websites that students use, meaning that their dates for important assignments, projects, events, and activities are scattered across multiple platforms. This requires students to create a spreadsheet or word document with a list of their assignments if they want all their assignments in one spot and have a separate calendar for events. My startup will be a place where students can input all of their important dates so they can look at one website and see what they have to do for that day. Plus since this is online, it will be much easier to access from other devices compared to an Excel sheet.

## Key Features
- Access on any device
- Share with friends
- Reminder emails/messages

### Authentication
Users will create an account that will save their calendars and notes.

### Database Data
The user will create a calendar that can be updated and changed at any point. 

### WebSocket Data
The program will send out reminder emails/messages and can be shared with friends.
