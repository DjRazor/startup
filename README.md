# Startup

## Elevator Pitch
For my startup (Trackinator), I want to create the ultimate scheduling calendar for students. In school, there are several different programs or websites that students use, meaning that their dates for important assignments, projects, events, and activities are scattered across multiple platforms. This requires students to create a spreadsheet or word document with a list of their assignments if they want all their assignments in one spot and have a separate calendar for events. My startup will be a place where students can input all of their important dates so they can look at one website and see what they have to do for that day. Plus since this is online, it will be much easier to access from other devices compared to an Excel sheet.

For my startup, I want to create a website to host and display my video editing and website-making skills. This will be a platform to connect me with people who are in the works of starting their own company/business. In essence, this startup will be a startup for other startups. I will edit and/or teach how I am able to do what I do.
